        <h2 id="title_hedy"><center>The Life of Hedy</center></h2>
        <p> 1914: A <strong>star</strong> is born.</p>
        <p>As a child, Lamarr was always interested in acting and was very fascinated by theatre and film. At the age of 12, she won a beauty contest in Vienna. I think this was among the moments that really steered her towards her journey to Hollywood.</p>
        <p>
          The Golden Age of Hollywood created some of the best-known celebrities in the history of moving pictures. Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth, Lauren Bacall, Audrey Hepburn―these are just some of the household names.</p>

        <p>
          But in the early days of Hollywood, one woman was considered the most beautiful of them all–and later proved to be much, much more. Hedy Lamarr, an Austrian-born actress, starred in a number of black-and-white box-office hits, like the 1941 Ziegfeld Girl and Experiment Perilous in 1944.
          </p> 
        <p>
          Something interesting abou her is that she was not just a pretty face on the screens but was also a <strong>self taught scientist</strong>. She was an admirable woman who not only made films worth watching But also came up with some cutting edge technology that later led to the invention of Wi-Fi and GPS. Pretty dope huh!
        </p>
        <p>
          The most beautiful woman in the world had experience with military equipment because her ex-husband, from whom she fled due to his staunch support for the Nazi Party, was an ammunition manufacturer, deeply involved with the arms industry of the Third Reich.
        </p>
        <p>
          She became familiar with the developing weapons industry of the time, so much so that she could pinpoint the weak spots within military technology that could be corrected.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time, the radio-guided torpedoes that used wireless technology were easily jammed by enemy frequency, causing the missile to divert its course. Together with Antheil, she saw an opportunity to develop a device capable of effectively overcoming any jamming distributed by the enemy. Using a principle based on the paper player piano rolls, the signal would constantly be “hopping,” becoming impossible to track.
        </p>
        <p>
             The principle enabled the jamming-resistant torpedo to use 88 possible frequencies, for that was the number of keys on a piano, creating a random code, known only to the controller of the torpedo. In this way, the signal became highly resilient to jamming and almost impossible to intercept.     
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though experiments involving the spread-spectrum radio were conducted in the early 20th century, with discoveries even being implemented by the German Army during World War I, the novel approach of using the piano principle and the exact role of the device was solely Lamar’s and Antheil’s invention.
